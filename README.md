This project was used to investigate the use of Google maps and photo capturing services within an Angular 5 application.

When out and about, if you see something that you think would be a cool photo, but don't have your camera. Open the app, add a new entry of what you want to come back and photograph. Then when you're trying to think of something to photograph at a later date, open the app and see what entries you have.
